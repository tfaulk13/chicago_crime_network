# chicago_crime_network

This is a Shiny application that analyzes publicly released chicago crime data (https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Courts/Initiation/7mck-ehwz) through a handful of different lenses. If you provide an ID number for a suspect, you can view:

1) Their criminal history summary (a datatable);
2) A timeline of their incidents;
3) A social network that shows any other suspects with which they've been associated.

I originally developed a similar but more complex app for the San Francisco District Attorney's office during my 2018 summer intership there. I have retrofitted the most essential parts to Chicago crime data so as to not expose any sensitive information around the data I used in San Francisco.
